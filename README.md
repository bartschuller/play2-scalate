What you see now is just a play project where I tried out what it takes to use Scalate in play2. But when thinking how people would want to use it, I guess it's important that the templates conform to play. This means type-safe parameter passing but also making sure that whatever you can do in play's templates, you can do in scalate.

This will probably involve only using Scalate's template parsers and implement our own code generation. And hooking it into play2.

Currently, working on this is not that high on my list of pet projects, so feel free to step in.
